# Personal Website Project
This is a personal website I’m building as part of my journey to learn basic web coding. As a complete beginner, I’m using this project to experiment with web technologies and to test the possibilities of learning and creating solely with AI assistance, specifically Grok. The site is purely static for cost-effective hosting on Cloudflare Pages and will feature animations—either through JavaScript or pre-rendered videos—as I explore both options. It’s not content-heavy; it’s more of a playground to see what a beginner can achieve with AI guidance.

## Technologies Used
   - HTML5 - For the site’s structure
   - CSS3 - For styling and layout
   - JavaScript - For interactivity and potential animations
   - Cloudflare Pages - For hosting the static site
> [!NOTE]
> I’m still deciding on animation tools—possibly JavaScript libraries like GSAP or Anime.js, or pre-rendered videos. This section will evolve as I progress.

## Setup
To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ldrex/torquoise.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd torquoise
```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
Since it’s a static site, no server setup is required—just a browser will do!

## AI Assistance
This project doubles as an experiment in learning to code with AI. I’m relying entirely on Grok 3 to:
   - Generate code snippets for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Explain web development concepts as I go
   - Help debug issues I encounter
   - Draft documentation, like this README (with some tweaks from me)
It’s a test of how far a total beginner can get with AI as the only teacher and co-creator.

## Future Plans
Here’s what I’m aiming to add as I learn:
   - Interactive animations using JavaScript (maybe with libraries like GSAP or Anime.js)
   - Pre-rendered video elements for dynamic backgrounds
   - A sharper, more polished design
   - Additional pages to expand the site as my skills grow

## Notes
   - Work in Progress: This is a learning experiment, so expect frequent changes to the code and design as I figure things out.
   - Code Quality: Since I’m new and using AI-generated code, some parts might not be “perfect” by pro standards. That’s part of the journey, I’m learning what works and what doesn’t.
